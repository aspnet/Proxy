This repo hosts a proxy library for ASP.NET Core. This is a prototype implementation and we do not currently have plans for futher development. If you are intersted in using this we recomend you fork the repo and customize it to suite your needs.

This project is part of ASP.NET Core. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET Core at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.
